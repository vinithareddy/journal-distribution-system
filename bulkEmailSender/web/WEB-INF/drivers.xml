    Description:
        Used by DriverUtilities2. Here you configure information about your
        database server in XML. To add a driver, include a vendor keyword,
        description, driver-class and URL. For general use, th ehost and database
        name should not be cinluded in the URl; a special notation is required
        for the host and database name. Use [$host] as a placeholder for the host
        server and [$dbName] as a placeholder for the database name.
        Specify the actual host and database name when making call to
        makeUrl (DriverUtilities). Then, the appropriate strings will be
        substituted for [$host] and [$dbName] before the URLis returned.
